# Unciv-damage-calculator
A web-based damage calculator for [Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv) and Civilization V.

## How to Use  
1. Enter **attacker and defender strength** after modifiers, if you can't see it in your game, you can calculate it yourself easily (base*(1+modifier1+modifier2...etc)).  
2. Set **unit health** (default: 100, for cities always assume they have 100).  
3. Click **"Calculate outcome!"** to see average damage, minimum and maximum.

## Details  
- Built with **HTML, CSS and JavaScript** (no frameworks).  
- Formula based on Uncivâ€™s open code.
- Should also work for Civilization V

Open to suggestions.
